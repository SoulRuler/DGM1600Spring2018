//Switch are the alternate to if statements

//if are only good when it comes to true or false

//Anthony never uses if statements any more

//He only usues them if it is on and off, open or close

// It starts with the keywork switch(){}

//A switch is a dedective or surelock

//we use the keyword case, we case what we are looking for

// if we have a var string, and we serch that word string for different possibilities and we 
//case the work passworkd, we do work in the case function. 

//Switch(Argument){
//
//	case
//	if it is one of the things you are argumenting, do work
//
//}

//We can case anything we want, but it needs the same value type

//Case password then next level

//Dont case numbers (you can, but dont)

//you can use scriptable objects

//we are going to learn to case enum, stings and scriptables objects and maybe tags
