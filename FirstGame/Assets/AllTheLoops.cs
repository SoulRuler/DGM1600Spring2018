//Looping is also interpreted as interating

//loops repeat

//Start with while and it will continue to repeat if the conditions are true

//this code will keep minusing cups until it gets to zero

//do while do it at the end while while does it at the beginnign. 

//we start with do, then the we go to the meat and then the while which will see if we contuinue or not

//Do while loops always run at least once. 

//for loops funchions like while but it different

//we start with for then (three sections)

//first section is optional, lets us declair stuff it runs once at begingging of loop

//Middle is conditional that will function every time the loop repeats

//third lets us add or minus any variables and will repeat each time

//semi colon to seperate these things

//Lest loop uis for each which is good at going throughj lists

//it loops through colections until it reaches the end of the collection.
