//Funcations allow you to make a function with instructions

//They also allow you to re use your instructions as long as you want

//You are allowed to make your own voids

//as in void run so you dont have to write it out every single time

//You can make anything a voide when it comes to the functions

//As seen above i have made fun a voide and put it in the start void function
