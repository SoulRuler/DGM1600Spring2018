//So everything is in boxes which take comands and follow orders

//Pretty much everything is possible when you are coding

//Start starts, print prints, it is very simple when it comes down to everything

//everything has to be in brackets for it to work  (the boxes are like space helmets, you cannot live with out them on)

//void isnt nothing it is just saying it does work and does not give anything back. 

//you can have several boxes doing similar things or several boxes with in themselves
